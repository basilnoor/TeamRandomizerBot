# TeamRandomizerBot

<h3> Note: </h3>
- For now, if you wish to use this bot in your discord server simply clone the repository and run the trbot.py file. 
- Currently, working on hosting it live so you would only have to invite the discord bot.
<br />

<h3> Project Goals: </h3>

- Made a class-based program implementing inheritance in Python.
- Utilized agile software development methodologies.
- Wrote descriptive docstrings and comments to improve code readability.
- Performed unit testing on codebase by using pythonâ€™s unittest module to assert that the logic of the program is correct.

Future Goals:
- Host discord bot online so users can simply invite the TR bot into their discord server and use it freely.
  - *Currently trying to find a free hosting service with persistance. Since TR bot utilizes SQLite3 for its database
  the hosting service has to consistantly update the database so that adding, removing, and editing players is instant
  for the user.*
