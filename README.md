# TeamRandomizerBot

Note:
- For now, if you wish to use this bot in your discord server simply clone the repository and run the trbot.py file.
- Currently, working on hosting it live so you would only have to invite the discord bot.


Project Goals:

- Made a class-based program implementing inheritance in Python.
- Utilized agile software development methodologies.
- Wrote descriptive docstrings and comments to improve code readability.
- Performed unit testing on codebase by using pythonâ€™s unittest module to assert that the logic of the program is correct.

Future Goals:
- ~~Create a discord bot with the same functionality, but allowing users to run the operations themselves.~~ 
- COMPLETED - See repository TeamRandomizerBot!
